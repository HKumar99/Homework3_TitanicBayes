Using Naive Bayes to predict survival on Titanic

Factors that will be considered: gender, age, ticket class

Three people! Who will survive?

- An Adult Male in First Class
- An Adult Female in Third Class
- A Male Child in Second Class

Based on Naive Bayes, I figured that the woman in third class will survive.
